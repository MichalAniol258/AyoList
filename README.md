# AyoList – Anime & Manga Tracker

A personal version of AniList built with **Next.js** and powered by the **AniList GraphQL API**.  
This app allows users to:

- 🔍 Search for anime and manga
- 📌 Save titles to personal lists
- ⭐ Rate and manage entries

> Inspired heavily by [AniList](https://anilist.co/), with a focus on learning and building my own interpretation of a great existing platform.

- 🗂️ **Add to lists** like "Watching", "Completed", "Planned"
- 📝 **Rate** and update entries
